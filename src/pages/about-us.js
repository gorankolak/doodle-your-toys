        If you want to turn your drawing into plush toy, you are in the right
        place!{" "}
      </p>
      <p>
        We have an individual approach to every plush toy we start making. Every
        specific detail on a drawing and every customer request regarding any
        feature of the final product is important to us, so we try to spend as
        much time as possible to achieve the best performance. We pay close
        attention to careful selection of materials and try to choose the most
        appropriate sewing technique every time we start developing a new toy.
        All of our toys are made with high quality fabrics (e.g., cotton,
        fleece, flannel) and stuffed with 100% polyester fiberfill.
      </p>
      <p>
        We are based in Croatia, Europe. Our team currently consists of three
        members:
