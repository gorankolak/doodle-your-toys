How cool is that? A pink plush giraffe - unique and timeless. Vincent and Virginia couldn't wait for this amazing softie to arrive at its final destination and we've been more than excited to deliver such a piece of art to their niece. In the end, she was to one who created Snowy and we just gave him a piece of reality to make it truly timeless. Arrivederci, Snowy!
