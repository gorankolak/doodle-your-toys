Today we have an interesting guest here with us. We want you to meet Silver, a super-cool cat softie!

Gianna, the artist and creator of this cute drawing character, haven’t told us much details about her, so we can only guess. We can see that she can dress nice, that’s for sure (and also very unusual for an ordinary cats). Who knows, maybe, like some famous cartoon heroes, she has a few super-powers?!
