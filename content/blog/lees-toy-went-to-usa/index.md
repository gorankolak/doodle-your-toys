A couple of months ago, we had received this interesting piece of children’s art. As you can see on the original photo, artist has provided to us a two-word description which also clearly explains his character’s pose. :) Since it is a pencil drawing, there are no lot’s of colors involved, so the main task for us was to find an appropriate skin colored material. We had a great fun with turning this drawing into a stuffed toy and we keep happily looking forward to many others that are yet to come to us.
