Wooo! Wait a second - did someone say pigeon in a waistcoat? It truly is a pigeon. In a waistcoat. We have just released one to fly to its owner, it couldn't wait to be released from a piece of paper. This special softie was nothing less than a true gentleman to our team - he waited patiently on our team to make a perfect plush waistcoat and showed such a gratitude afterwards. It was nice meeting you - have a safe flight!
