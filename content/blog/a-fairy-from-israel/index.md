We had a demanding task with turning this lovely children art into a plush doll. Inbar from Israel wanted us to use two of her daughterâ€™s drawings as a template for a fairy doll. Most of the details are recreated from the first drawing (a bigger sized photo) with a facial details used from another one (a left corner photo).
