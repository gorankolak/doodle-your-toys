Who doesn’t love their parents? This girl sure does. It hasn’t been a long way from school work to plush toy - we are familiar with that feeling and we couldn’t wait to make it as a toy. This family now has a unique artwork attached to their fridge and very same stuffed toy - certainly the most unique accessories to their home. Parents agreed - “They are perfect!”
