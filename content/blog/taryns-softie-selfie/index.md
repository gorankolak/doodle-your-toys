Unique selfie, indeed! Ashley’s niece drew herself as a unique animal with green tentacles - what an imagination. We believe it has interesting superpowers and we used one of ours to create stuffed toy as a special gift for Ashley’s niece. Can’t wait to see her reaction when drawing becomes real. Check out with us!
