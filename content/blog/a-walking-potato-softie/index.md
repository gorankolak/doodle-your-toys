According to information we recieved about this drawing, this is a potato. A very colorful one, we might add. Usually, potatos don’t go walking around, smiling and feeling happy, waving with their arms and legs (which they, also, usually don’t have). But, this one does! Our new plush toy made from drawing goes to David.
