Yes! All checked. Ready for the road. A couple of weeks ago it was just a drawing (a very nice drawing though) and now it’s turned to something much more. A real vehicle! Before sending this awesome car back to his owner, we had to take a test drive. We were realy surprised by its performance. Very fast! Especially considering that it is a plush toy car.
