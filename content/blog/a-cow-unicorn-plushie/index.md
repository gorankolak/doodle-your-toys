It’s always worth seeing that we’ve exceeded someone’s expectations at the very end of this creative process. We didn’t hold ourselves when we got into his task which was marketing purpose only. It was our absolute pleasure to deliver this custom cow plush toy at the high standard and even more when we get to experience such a satisfaction during and after this creative process. Such a unique black dotted cow drawing with a unicorn horn was definitely something different and we couldn’t wait to see its plush body to come together. It is always nice to see that people acknowledge our efforts to make each one of their drawings ‘alive’. Cheers to that!
