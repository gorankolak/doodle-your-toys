A four year old boy from Ireland had major wish to have a real cat made from his drawing. We managed to make stuffed cat toy similar to one that he wished for, filled with a lot of love. With big heart on tummy and huge smile on cats face, we are dispatching this plush pet toy to one happy kid, expecting from him to care about that toy and be even happier.
